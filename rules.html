        <p>All players start out with a piece on the first square. Throughout the game, there will be 5 types of squares: Normal, Teleport, Buff, Debuff, and Cripple. As the name suggests, the Normal square is normal, there are no special effects. The Teleport squares are paired, and you can only travel between the pairs. The Buff squares allows you to advance further ahead than a normal roll. Likewise, the Debuff squares either slow your advance or send you back a few steps. Now the Cripple squares are a bit unique in that they have a Debuff effect . . . but on the opponent instead of yourself. What this means is that when you land on the cripple square, you are then able to choose an opponent who will be Debuffed.</p>
